The system on chip(SoC) of the raspberry pi has a temperature sensor. This project shows the measurement from the temperature sensor in the rapsberry pi and shows the data in visualized graph.

This project might be useful to check out the temperature of raspberry pi in visual way, so that it would be helpful to prevent the pi from overheating.

What is needed is the raspberry pi and matplotlib using python.

You can get more help through https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/temperature-log if needed.
